# Semantic Subtyping

Semantic subtyping is an intuitive type system in which types correspond directly to sets.

This is an implementation of semantic subtyping as described by [Giuseppe Castagna](https://www.irif.fr/~gc/) in [Covariance and Contravariance: A Fresh Look at an Old Issue](https://www.irif.fr/~gc/papers/covcon-again.pdf).
